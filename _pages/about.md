I am currently a master's student in Computational Science and Engineering at the Department of Mathematics, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland. Before this, I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.

I'm interested in causality and machine learning. In daily life, I'm a fan of football and fantasy fictions.
