We mostly work with directed graphs, i.e., \((v,w) \in \mathbf{E} \Rightarrow (w,v) \notin \mathbf{E}\).</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>path</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A sequence of vertices connected by edges, e.g. \(A\rightarrow B\leftarrow C\rightarrow D\)</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>collider on a path</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A specific configuration on a path where two arrows meet head-to-head at a vertex, e.g. \(B\) is a collider on path \(A\rightarrow B\leftarrow C\rightarrow D\)</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>directed path (dir. path)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A path where all the edges are directed in the same direction, e.g. \(E\rightarrow F\rightarrow G\rightarrow H\)</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>v-structure</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>An arrangement of three variables where two have arrows directed towards the third and these two are not directly connected. For example, in causal graph \(A\rightarrow B\leftarrow C\rightarrow D\), \(A\rightarrow B\leftarrow C\) forms a v-structure. On the contrary, if \(A\) and \(C\) are directly connected in this causal graph, then \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) no longer form a v-structure.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>directed cycle (dir. cycle)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A path that starts and ends at the same vertex with all edges directed in a consistent direction.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</strong> <blockquote> <p>A graph with no directed cycles.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>PA (Parents)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>For a vertex \(X\) in a graph, its set of parents, denoted as \(PA_X\), is the set of all vertices that have a direct edge leading to this vertex.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>CH (Children)</strong> <blockquote> <p>For a vertex \(X\) in a graph, its set of children, denoted as \(CH_X\), is the set of vertices that this vertex points to directly through outgoing edges.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>DE (Descendants)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>For a vertex \(X\) in a graph, its set of descendants, denoted as \(DE_X\), includes all vertices that can be reached by following directed paths starting from this vertex</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>ND (Non-Descendants)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>For a vertex \(X\) in a graph, its set of non-descendants, denoted as \(ND_X\), is the set of vertices that are neither descendants nor the vertex itself.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>AN (Ancestors)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>For a vertex \(X\) in a graph, its set of ancestors, denoted as \(AN_X\), includes all vertices from which there is a directed path leading to this vertex.</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Given definitions above, in a graph \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathbf{V}, \mathbf{E})\), for each vertex \(X\in\mathbf{V}\), the set of vertices can be split into three disjoint subsets \(\mathbf{V} = ND_X\sqcup DE_X \sqcup \{X\},\) where \(\sqcup\) means disjoint union. That is, for each vertex in a graph, the set of vertices is the disjoint union of its descendants, its non-descendants and itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="causality"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[SCM is built upon a graph]]></summary></entry></feed>
